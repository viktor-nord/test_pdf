While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits: \nWhen you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total. \nYour melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit. \nThese benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points. or until you use your Wild Shape again."},
